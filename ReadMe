# Rockets and Countries

## Description

This project will read in two data sets, collate them, print them to STDOUT, and
write them to disk.  There are two data sets getting compared:
- [rocket launch sites dataset](https://github.com/NattyBumppo/rocket-launch-history/blob/master/data/launch_sites.csv)
- [countries dataset](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv)
The program will read in both data sets and ask the
user to choose how to collate the data.  The options are to either print all of
the witches accused in the same town where a UFO sighting occurred or to print
all of the UFO sightings that occurred in the same month a witch was accused
(regardless of year).
